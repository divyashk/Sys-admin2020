## Question - 2
I initially used the 'whois' command in linux

```whois students.iitmandi.ac.in```

 but it returned an unsual 'No data found'.
So I went onto the site [whois.domaintools](https://whois.domaintools.com) and entered the domain [students.iitmandi.ac.in] there.
It listed ERNET India[http://www.ernet.in] as the registrar after a successful captcha.
